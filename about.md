Hi, I'm Alaukik. Welcome to my personal blog! I'm a senior at [Yale-NUS College](https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/vision-and-mission/) studying Computer Science. I am an aspiring Product-Minded Software Engineer interested in building software for start-ups.

I've previously interned at [SAP](https://www.sap.com/index.html) as a Software Developer and have been a visiting student at [Columbia Engineering](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu).
